        # 🎤 Rust Voice Recorder v${{ steps.get_version.outputs.version }}
        
        A simple, lightweight voice recorder built with Rust.
        
        ## ✅ Code Signed Executable
        
        This executable is code-signed to reduce Windows security warnings and antivirus false positives. While we use a self-signed certificate (to keep the project free), this still helps with many security software packages.
        
        ## ⚠️ Windows Security Note
        
        Windows may still show a security warning for self-signed certificates. This is normal and the software is completely safe to use.
        
        To run the application:
        1. Download and extract the zip file
        2. Run rust_voice.exe
        3. If Windows shows a warning, click "More info" then "Run anyway"
        
        ## ✨ Features
        
        - 🎤 Record audio using your microphone
        - ▶️ Play recordings with high-quality playback
        - ✏️ Rename recordings with custom names
        - 🗑️ Delete recordings you no longer need
        - ⌨️ Keyboard shortcuts:
          - Spacebar - Start/stop recording
          - P - Stop playback
        - 🎯 Lightweight - Small file size, no installation required
        - 🔒 Privacy-focused - All recordings stay on your computer
        - ✅ Code-signed executable for better security compatibility
        
        ## 🚀 Usage
        
        1. Double-click rust_voice.exe to launch
        2. Click "● Record" or press Spacebar to start recording
        3. Click "■ Stop" or press Spacebar again to stop
        4. Your recording appears in the file list
        5. Use ► to play, Edit to rename, X to delete
        
        ## 🛠️ Technical Details
        
        - Audio Format: 48kHz WAV files
        - Built with: Rust, CPAL (audio), Iced (GUI), Hound (WAV)
        - Requirements: Windows 10/11 (64-bit)
        - Size: ~5MB executable
        - Security: Code-signed with SHA-256 timestamping
        
        ## 🐛 Troubleshooting
        
        No sound during recording?
        - Check your microphone permissions in Windows Settings
        - Ensure your microphone is set as the default recording device
        
        Can't hear playback?
        - Check your speaker/headphone volume
        - Ensure your audio output device is working

          ## 🚀 What's New in ${{ steps.get_version.outputs.tag }}
          
          A lightweight, privacy-focused voice recorder built with Rust.
          
          ### ✨ Features
          - 🎤 High-quality audio recording (48kHz WAV)
          - ▶️ Instant playback of recordings  
          - ✏️ Easy file renaming and management
          - ⌨️ Convenient keyboard shortcuts
          - 🔒 Complete privacy - all data stays local
          - ✅ **Code-signed executable** for better Windows compatibility
          
          ### 📥 Installation
          1. Download the zip file below
          2. Extract rust_voice.exe anywhere on your computer
          3. Run the executable - no installation needed!
          
          ### ✅ Code Signing Improvements
          
          This release includes a **code-signed executable** which should significantly reduce:
          - Windows security warnings
          - Antivirus false positives
          - Download blocks from browsers
          
          While we use a self-signed certificate (to keep the project free), this still provides much better compatibility than unsigned executables.
          
          ### 🎯 Quick Start
          - Press Spacebar to start/stop recording
          - Press P to stop playback  
          - All recordings saved as WAV files in app folder
